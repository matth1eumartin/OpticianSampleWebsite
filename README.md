# OpticianSampleWebsite

## Description
This project was designed in Figma (first time!) and developed by yours truly. The company for which the website was developed is a real local opticians, for which I have previously developed software for managing customer databases while I was still in High School, but I don't currently intend to monetize this website. The frontend is built using React.js components that are styled using TailwindCSS and animated using Framer Motion - TailwindCSS was incredibly handy to make the website fully responsive for both mobile devices and desktop computers. The backend was developed using the Python Flask library to create a REST API that interacted with an SQLite database to store customer details, customer bookings and available bookings.

## Accessing the Project
While I'd rather not share the full code for the project, I have included a series of unlisted YouTube video demonstrations of different functionalities that the website exhibits. I am always open for a chat if you'd like to discuss the project further!

Thank you very much for reading all this if you made it this far, I hope you enjoyed :)
